Strawberry Compote	"Strawberry Compote (клубничный компот) is a chilled sweet drink that is popular in many post-soviet countries. It is similar to strawberry jam or conserves in taste (less sweet/concentrated flavor), but resembles fruit punch in looks and consistency. It is very easy to adjust this recipe and scale it up/down.|FYI, I suggest using organic strawberries for this (may be on the expensive side), it makes a world of difference in flavor."	drinks	medium	2.34	soft drink|strawberry|russian	Strawberries (two standard packs works best)|Sugar	Get 3 bowls and a butter knife (if the butter knife has a point, that will work better)|Dump out both packs of strawberries into a sieve or bowl and wash them thoroughly.|Remove the stem and leaves/crown of the strawberry.

Serve chilled.
